    summary: "NexSpace provides 5 core operational workflows: Ingest & Upload, Natural Language Query & Grounding, Bi-Temporal Change Analysis, Evidence Verification, and Automated Intelligence Reports.",
    detailedText: "In NexSpace you can:\n• **Upload & Ingest**: Process optical and SAR rasters into Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs.\n• **Natural Language Query**: Detect specific objects (buildings, roads, vessels, water) using Grounding DINO and ask questions with PaliGemma VQA.\n• **Change Detection**: Perform bi-temporal pixel differencing and anomaly extraction across two dates.\n• **Evidence Viewer**: Inspect bounding boxes, confidence metrics, and spatial localization.\n• **Execution Trace**: Review step-by-step model inference pipelines.\n• **Reports**: Generate and export structured geospatial investigation summaries and PDFs.",

    question: "How does Automatic Satellite Imagery Acquisition work in NexSpace?",
    summary: "NexSpace automatically acquires high-resolution satellite imagery from Copernicus Sentinel-2 (10m) with Landsat 8/9 fallback based on natural language location queries.",
    detailedText: "You do NOT need to search or upload images manually. Simply type a query with any location name (e.g. *'Scan Gomti Nagar, Lucknow for recent changes'* or *'Locate buildings in Marine Drive, Mumbai'*). NexSpace automatically geocodes the location, calculates the Area of Interest (AOI), queries the Copernicus Sentinel-2 L2A archive (filtering for <15% cloud cover), and falls back to Landsat 9 if needed, feeding the AOI directly into the AI analysis pipeline.",

    detailedText: "Go to the **Upload Ingest** page (/upload). You can drag and drop custom raster files (GeoTIFF, TIFF, PNG, JPEG, or ZIP bundles with multispectral bands like RGB, NIR, SWIR). NexSpace validates projections (e.g. EPSG:32651), extracts geospatial metadata, and preserves the uploaded image across all analysis terminals without overriding.",

    question: "How do I detect buildings, vehicles, or infrastructure in satellite imagery?",
    summary: "NexSpace uses open-vocabulary neural grounding (Grounding DINO) to locate objects from natural language prompts.",
    detailedText: "Navigate to the **Query** page (/query) with an uploaded or demo image. Type a prompt like *'Locate the buildings'* or *'Detect vessels in the harbor'*. Grounding DINO identifies target objects, generates normalized bounding boxes (0..1000 coordinate space), calculates spatial coordinates, and links them to verifiable evidence cards.",

    summary: "Yes, NexSpace routes visual questions to specialized remote sensing VQA models (PaliGemma / RSVQA) and BLIP captioning.",
    detailedText: "On the **Query** page (/query), ask natural language questions such as *'Is there water present?'* or *'Describe this scene'*. NexSpace decomposes complex queries into binary sub-questions, executes neural VQA, and produces confidence-calibrated findings with execution reasoning.",

    summary: "The Bi-Temporal Change Analysis Terminal compares two registered images from different dates to highlight pixel deltas and anomalies.",
    detailedText: "Go to the **Comparison** page (/comparison). Upload or select two images (Image A: Before, Image B: After). NexSpace computes co-registered differential pixel intensity, generates an interactive opacity slider and delta heatmap, clusters anomaly regions with severity scores (High/Medium/Low), and calculates the percentage of changed surface area.",

    summary: "SAR uses microwave radar pulses to penetrate clouds, smoke, and darkness, providing all-weather 24/7 earth observation.",
    detailedText: "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sends active radio frequency pulses and measures backscatter reflections. Unlike optical cameras, SAR works at night and through cloud cover. In NexSpace, you can analyze SAR rasters, generate SAR descriptions, and perform Optical + SAR multi-modal feature fusion to verify surface dielectric and structural properties.",

    summary: "NexSpace preserves Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS/EPSG), georeferenced transforms, and exports GeoJSON feature collections.",
    detailedText: "When GeoTIFF rasters are uploaded, NexSpace extracts native CRS metadata (such as UTM Projected or WGS84 Geographic) and affine transform matrices. Detected object bounding boxes and change anomalies are transformed into real-world geographic coordinates and GeoJSON polygons with ground area calculations (m² / km²).",
